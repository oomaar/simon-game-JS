# simon-game-JS
This is a game that is modeled by the simon game.
It is also can be considered as a Memory Muscle Game.

The way it works:-
1- You press any key to start. ✅
2- It will show you a pattern that you will follow by clicking on the squares. 🎮
3- as you move from level to level the pattern gets more complicated. 🚀
4- And when click on the wrong pattern the GAME IS OVER. ❌

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript adn Jquery.
